- I am a software developer with over 3 years of experience. 

  I have worn many hats and specialized in multiple areas along my career, but in recent years my focus has converged into a narrower set of technologies:

1) React JS, React Native, Vue JS
2) Node, Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Mongo

- React and Next.js is my passion and what I'm best at. 
  I have helped various startups in the past few years to kick-start their project right from the concept level by building websites in the JavaScript environment. I owe all my success to the clients I have worked for, so my goal is always to keep them satisfied and happy with whatever work I do.
